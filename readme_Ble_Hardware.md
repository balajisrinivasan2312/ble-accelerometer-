Hardware Setup:
BLE Accelerometer:

Choose a BLE accelerometer sensor that suits your requirements.
Ensure the accelerometer supports BLE communication. Common protocols include GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) for data exchange.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Module:

If the accelerometer doesn't have built-in BLE, you may need a separate BLE module to enable communication.
Software Development:
Programming Language:

Choose a programming language for your application. Python is a popular choice due to its simplicity and the availability of BLE libraries.
BLE Library:

Use a BLE library to communicate with the BLE device. Some popular choices include:
Python: bluepy, pygatt, pybleio
Node.js: noble
Android: Android's built-in BLE API
iOS: CoreBluetooth framework
Scan for BLE Devices:

Implement code to scan for available BLE devices in the vicinity.
Connect to the Accelerometer:

Establish a connection to the BLE accelerometer using the device's unique identifier (UUID).
